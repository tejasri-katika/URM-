              Institutions play crucial roles in promoting diversity and inclusion in the job market. These employers actively participate in URM specified job applications to demonstrate their commitment to diversity and connect with talented URM candidates.
            </p>
            <p>
              By offering diverse job opportunities and inclusive hiring practices, these institutions foster a more representative workforce that reflects the broader community they serve. Their involvement also leads to stronger partnerships with other institutions and organizations committed to diversity, enhances their reputation as inclusive employers, and contributes to a more equitable job market for URM candidates.
